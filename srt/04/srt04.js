1 - 24. Classical Music - lang_en_vs6.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,720
A researcher finds that students who listen to classical music in elementary

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:09,651
school tend to have better grades in high school. There was no random assignment

3
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:14,557
to conditions or manipulation of an independent variable. In other words, they

4
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:19,285
didn't just look at a bunch of random students. We might not even know which

5
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:24,095
students they looked at. But then the researcher recommends that children should

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:28,515
listen to classical music, because that will cause them to perform better in

7
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:32,195
school. What's wrong with this logic? Select all that apply.`;

2 - 25. Caffeine - lang_en_vs8.srt

00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,264
This scatter plot here shows the relationship between the number of caffeinated

2
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:10,019
drinks people consume, and the hours that they sleep. Each of these dots

3
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:15,187
represents one person. So, for example, this person consumed about 3 caffeinated

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,284
drinks and only slept about 5 hours. This data was collected from a survey of 9

00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:23,746
individuals. From this graph, what can you conclude?`;

3 - 26. Video Games - lang_en_vs5.srt

A researcher found a relationship between the number of hours spent playing

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,201
violent video games per week and the level of aggression shown by adolescent

3
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:13,345
males. This is measured by the aggression scale, which is someone's

4
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:17,749
self-reported measure of aggressive behavior. More hours spent playing

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:23,305
corresponded with a higher aggression score. Given this information, what can we

6
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:24,127
say is true?`;

4 - 27. English Teaching - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,791
At an elementary school, there are a lot of students for which Spanish is their

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:09,513
first language. Now let's say there are two ways of teaching English to them.

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:14,335
One way is to only teach them in English. Another way is to teach them in both

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:19,283
English and Spanish. So researchers randomly assigned students to one of these

5
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:24,844
two groups. One student were assigned to either being taught in English only or

6
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:29,989
in both Spanish and English, it stayed that way. After a while, the researchers

7
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:35,036
gave each student a reading comprehension test. On the day of testing for the

8
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:40,105
English only group, the temperature was 72 degrees Fahrenheit. But for the

9
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:45,870
bilingual group the temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is pretty hot.

10
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:51,365
When the scores were calculated, the English only group had an average of 70%,

11
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:54,815
while the bilingual group had an average of 55%.`;

5 - 34. Landmines - lang_en_vs5.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,498
This is an African pouched rat. They're particularly good at detecting TNT and

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,996
landmines. They're trained using something called tea eggs, which have TNT in

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:16,491
them. TNT is an explosive found in many land mines. If the African pouched rats

4
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:21,702
were able to find the tea eggs. They were given a food reward. But if they

5
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:26,386
scratched near tea eggs that did not contain TNT, then they did not receive a

6
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:31,335
food reward. Scratching near the tea eggs was considered the indicator response.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,377
The researchers found that the training was very successful in teaching the rats

8
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:41,265
to detect real landmines in the field. This was measured by the number of meters

9
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:47,021
of land cleared by explosives. And by the number of landmines that they found.

Based on this study, what can we say is true?`;

6 - 37. Insomnia - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,603
Lets say we randomly assigned people with insomnia to one of two treatment

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:09,689
conditions. In one condition, participants received 20 milligrams of ambien, and

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:14,568
in the other condition patients received a placebo pill. The participants did

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,795
not know which they received. After taking their pills, the participants slept

5
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:25,085
in a sleep laboratory to help control for lurking variables. The next morning,

6
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:30,272
they rated their quality of sleep on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very poor

7
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:35,030
quality of sleep and 10 being excellent. They reported this scale to a

8
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:40,371
psychologist who also did not know which treatment each person was assigned to.

9
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:45,345
It turns out that the people in the ambien group reported a higher quality of

10
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:50,295
sleep with an average of 8, whereas the people in the placebo group reported an

11
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:54,920
average of 5. What can we say is true about this scenario? Select all that

7 - 39. SAD - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,194
Have you ever had the winter blues? Where you're just depressed during the

2
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:08,698
winter? For some people, this is an actual recognized disorder called seasonal

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,016
affective disorder. This applies to any season. Throughout most of the year,

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:17,433
people with SAD have normal mental health, but experience depression during

5
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:22,624
certain seasons, even, Even spring or summer. Researchers tried to figure out

6
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:28,055
how to treat SAD. 95 people were randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

7
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:33,777
Bright light therapy which is where participants were exposed to 10,000 lux for

8
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:38,166
30 minutes every morning From 6 o'clock until 6:30 a.m.

9
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:44,711
Lux is the international standard measurement of illuminance. The second group

10
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:51,133
received dawn simulation, which was a dawn signal in which people were exposed

11
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:57,338
to lux that peaked at 250. And this lasted 1.5 hours, and the third was a

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,901
placebo condition, which was just 1.5 hours of a dim red light at only .5 lux.

13
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:07,376
This lasted from 4:30AM until 6:00AM.

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,218
The number of people in each group was as follows, 33 in the bright light, 31 in

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:20,211
the dawn simulation, and 31 in the placebo. After six weeks, all the subjects

16
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:26,129
were blindly rated by a psychiatrist. So the psychiatrist did not know which

17
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:31,479
treatment each person was exposed to. The psychiatrist uses the structured

18
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:36,017
interview guide for the Hamilton Depression ration for seasonal affective

19
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:40,747
disorder. This measures a person's level of this type of depression on a scale

20
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,544
of 0 to 89, with higher numbers indicating greater severity of depression. The

21
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:50,216
researchers found that dawn simulation was associated with greater recovery.

22
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:54,405
That is compared to the placebo group and the bright light therapy group.`;
