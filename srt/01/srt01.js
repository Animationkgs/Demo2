01 - Welcome - lang_en_vs1.srt
1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to statistics,
the science of decisions.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,762
But before we get started with
the class Sean, Katie, and

3
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:11,020
I want to talk to you a little bit about
what our expectations are for you and

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,820
what you should expect
to learn in the class.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,420
&gt;&gt; As you know,
this is an online course and

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,770
online courses differ greatly
from in-class courses.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,420
First, you will not be coming to
a classroom two to three times a week.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,100
Instead, you'll be working from home or
wherever.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,040
Whether it's on a mobile device,
a tablet or a PC.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,942
One thing that you should notice is
that this is a self-paced course.

11
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:37,100
That means, you are responsible for
deciding when and

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,200
where you complete the material.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,500
&gt;&gt; Because this is online and
this is self-paced,

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,210
a lot of the responsibility
falls on you.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,100
You need to find the motivation
to come to class,

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,530
and, by class, I mean going to
the online course every day.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,310
It's important that you distribute
your learning over time.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,470
Online courses,
it's easy to fall away and

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,200
forget about them because you're
not driving to a campus every day.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,410
So you have to remember to check in and
time manage, in a way, so

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,780
that you are learning a little
bit about statistics every day.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,430
That will make the learning better and

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,140
that will make the course
a lot more enjoyable.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,420
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is important for

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,150
you guys to take responsibility, but the
main objective is for you guys to learn.

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,930
And, yes, you're going to struggle
sometimes, but that's the whole point.

27
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,220
At Udacity, we want to give you
a quiz to make you struggle first, so

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,060
that you form your own ideas about this
concept before we start teaching you

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,800
the formalized statistical
way of learning it.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,960
&gt;&gt; I would also encourage you to
take advantage of your classmates.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,650
There's a lot of knowledge out there and

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,280
there's a lot of knowledge about
statistics already, so use each other.`;

02 - Intro - lang_en_writeautosub.srt
2 - Intro --write-auto-sub
welcome to elementary statistics we're
really excited to have you on board
my name is Katie and I'm the one who
will be explaining most of the concepts
throughout this course also be doing a
lot of drawing and a lot of writing to
help you understand the content as much
as possible in each of the 16 lessons in
this course you'll learn new methods to
describe and analyze data each lesson
builds on the concepts you learned
before so as you progress through the
course try to get a good grasp of the
material before moving on but if it
turns out you need a review no big deal
you can easily go back and re-watch the
videos and redo the exercises what do I
mean by exercises each lesson consists
of short instructional videos where I
explain cool stat stuff and guide your
thinking but we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own so instead of
just telling you a factor formula we'll
ask a quiz a quiz or exercise same thing
is not there for us to judge you or to
impact your grade it's there for your
own benefit to make you think at udacity
we believe that the chance to think
about something from your own unique
perspective is a powerful learning
opportunity`;

1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,680
For example, let's say you have a jar of M&amp;Ms. If

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,700
you reached in and randomly grabbed one, what color do you think

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,960
it would most likely be? Red, blue, green, orange, or yellow?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,390
Click the radio button that corresponds to the answer you would choose.`;


var srt0104= `
04 - MnMs Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,200
Well, our best guess would be blue, since most

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,510
of the M and M's are blue. See? A lot

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,120
of statistics is just about using your intuition. In this

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,160
course, you'll build on the intuition that you already have.`;

05 - Definitely blue - lang_en_vs2.srt
1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,290
Quizzes won't always be multiple choice, like this one. For example,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,670
let's ask another question. If you reach your hand in this jar

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,400
of M&amp;Ms and randomly grab one, just like in the last

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,930
quiz, will it definitely be blue? This time, type yes or no.`;


var srt0106= `
06 - Definitely blue Solution - lang_en_vs2.srt
1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,850
The answer is no. You could get green, orange, or red, or yellow since those

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,029
are also in the jar. But most likely,

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,430
you'll get blue. Later in this course you'll

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,360
learn how samples, in this case the sample is the one M&amp;M that you pulled out,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,160
can be used to learn about the population, which is like the whole jar of M&amp;Ms.`;

07 - Problem Sets - lang_en_vs2.srt
1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,890
So Lessons contain instructional videos, quizzes and

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,870
solution videos. In addition to these quizzes

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,260
interspersed throughout the lessons, you'll find a

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,270
problem set at the end of every lesson

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,080
including this one. Problem Sets allow you

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,950
to extend what you've learned to different

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,380
situations. These are more to solidify rather

8

any two people is 4.74 and it's going down. And I

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,880
believe it. There have been many times I ran into someone

discussion section at the bottom. Sometimes we'll have additional information

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,140
there, or a link to another page. You should see

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,070
a link there now. Oftentimes this link will go to a

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,360
Google spreed sheet with data for you to analyze. That's

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,410
right. In this class, you are going to learn how to

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,360
use spread sheets. A super practical, and useful skill. We've

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,300
found that Google spreadsheets is the best way to share data

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,050
with you for free. But to view the spreadsheet, you'll

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,320
need a Google account. Pause this video now, and click

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,950
the link below in Instructor Notes that says create a

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,430
Google account. If you already have one, you could skip this

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,700
step. Once you create your Google account, click the link

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,390
to view the Google spreadsheet. You'll see a bunch of

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,140
words written in various cells. A cell is one of

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,640
the rectangles in the table. And each cell has a name.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,600
For example, this is cell c3. This is cell b5. This is cell a1. Once

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,110
you open the spreadsheet, write the words in

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,760
the following cells to get the hidden message.`;

11 - Instructor Notes Solution - lang_en_vs2.srt
1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,025
Well if we open the spreadsheet, cell C14 says statistics,

2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:10,320
cell B6 says is, and D3 says

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,030
awesome, therefore the secret message is, statistics is awesome.`;

Good job. Now you know the names of the cells, but

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,230
usually instead of words in the cells we'll have numbers or data.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,650
If this is the case, you'll have to copy and paste

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,560
the data from the shared Google spread sheet, into your own spreed

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,970
sheet in order to analyze it. Lets get familiar with this.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,260
To create your own spreed sheet go to your Google Drive. All

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,600
of this is also explained in the Instructor Note section. If

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,270
you're signed in to your Google email account, you should see a

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,430
bar at the top that looks like this. You can click Drive, or you can just go

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,670
to drive.google.com. Make sure you're signed in. From your

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,320
Drive, I suggest your first step should be to

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,030
create a new folder for this class. To do

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,120
that, click this icon here. Name this whatever you

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,380
want. Maybe just Statistics. After you name it, you

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,260
should see a Statistics folder appear in your drive.

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,590
You can use this folder to store all the

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,620
datasets you work with throughout this class. Click on

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,860
it. Once you're in your Statistics folder, you can

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,270
create a new spreadsheet by clicking this button and selecting

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,840
Spreadsheet. You should then have a new spreadsheet that

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,700
looks like this. Then you can copy and paste

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,240
the data that I provide, like this flight cost

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,320
data. You just click Cmd+c, or Ctrl+c if you're on

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,414
a PC. And then you go to your

25
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:21,710
spreadsheet and click Cmd+v or Ctrl+v. Now you're able

26
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,150
to analyze the data. I recommend either creating a

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,940
new spreadsheet for each new dataset. Or, create a

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,140
new sheet within this same sheet by clicking this

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,420
plus sign at the bottom. Then you'll have a

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,850
new sheet within the same spreadsheet, in which you

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,370
can input a different dataset. Then you could call

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,600
this spreadsheet something like Statistics Datasets. And rename each

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,912
sheet to what it is, and what lesson. For example, this is

34
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:56,130
fFight Cost data from lesson 15. Alternatively, within

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,350
your Statistics folder, you can just continue

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,390
creating new spreadsheets. And then naming the entire

37
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,950
spreadsheet the name of that dataset that

38
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,570
I originally provide you. Its up to you.`;

00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,620
how much it snowed over the last three seasons in

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,670
Tahoe so that I can get a feel for how much

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,970
it'll snow this season. Every time it snowed, I listed

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,880
the inches of snowfall and the date. So when you

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,850
open the spreadsheet you should see three columns of data.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,320
One for each season. We want to know the total amount

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,180
of snowfall that occurred each season. When we're doing

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,000
any type of calculation in a spreadsheet, we start with

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,900
an equal sign. In this case, we want to sum

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,770
up all the numbers in each column. So I'll write

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,600
equals sum, and then the name of the start

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,260
cell, colon, and then the name of the end cell.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,270
This colon means that we sum all the numbers in

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,780
between the start cell and the end cell. And remember,

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,540
you've already learned how we denote the names of each cell. So, if we want

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,150
to know how much it snowed in season one, what should we put here, and here?`;

00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,715
The first value of season one is in cell A2. And the last value of season

2
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:12,020
one is cell A24. So we want cell A2 all the way,

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,050
as denoted by the colon, through cell A24. And then we'll take the sum.`;

00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,730
So, let's actually do the calculation for each

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,600
season. This time you'll have to copy and

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,119
paste the data into your own spreadsheet like

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,990
we showed you before. Highlight the data by

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:19,150
clicking and dragging from cell A1 all the way down to cell C27 since that will

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,099
ensure that all of the data is copied. Then type Cmd C or Ctrl+C to copy it.

7
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:30,223
Then go to your spreadsheet that you created in your statistics folder,

8
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:35,348
and type Ctrl or Cmd+V. Then in any of the blank cells, type your

9
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:40,530
command. Equal sum, and for Season 1, that would be

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,680
A2 to A24. For Season 2, you would type, equal sum

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,310
( B2 all the way to the end cell, then you'd do the same

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,630
process for the total sum for Season 3. Type in your answers here.`;

16 - Calculate sums Solution - lang_en_vs2.srt
1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,240
In this blank space, cell A26, we'll type equals sum

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,250
A2 colon A24. And we get that the total snowfall

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,950
was 122 inches in season one. For season two, we want the

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,840
sum from cell B2 all the way to cell B27. If

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,930
we type in this command and press Enter, we

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,330
get 173. Finally, in cell C28, I'll find the total

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,670
precipitation from season three. Which is from C2

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,480
to cell C26, and we get 129. So

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,200
it looks like it snowed the most in

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,760
season two. Great job. If this was tricky, don't

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,100
worry. You'll get better and better with using

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,520
Google Spreadsheets during this class, and by the

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,780
end, you'll be a pro. If you still

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,570
have questions, post in the forums. Your amazing peers

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,360
are always really quick to answer. But if this

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,250
was confusing, play around with Google Spreadsheets a little bit

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,570
more. It's important that you're comfortable with learning them,

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,080
because then you'll have a better experience throughout this course.`;
