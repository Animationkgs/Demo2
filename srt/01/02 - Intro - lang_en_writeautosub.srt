2 - Intro --write-auto-sub
welcome to elementary statistics we're
really excited to have you on board
my name is Katie and I'm the one who
will be explaining most of the concepts
throughout this course also be doing a
lot of drawing and a lot of writing to
help you understand the content as much
as possible in each of the 16 lessons in
this course you'll learn new methods to
describe and analyze data each lesson
builds on the concepts you learned
before so as you progress through the
course try to get a good grasp of the
material before moving on but if it
turns out you need a review no big deal
you can easily go back and re-watch the
videos and redo the exercises what do I
mean by exercises each lesson consists
of short instructional videos where I
explain cool stat stuff and guide your
thinking but we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own so instead of
just telling you a factor formula we'll
ask a quiz a quiz or exercise same thing
is not there for us to judge you or to
impact your grade it's there for your
own benefit to make you think at udacity
we believe that the chance to think
about something from your own unique
perspective is a powerful learning
opportunity
